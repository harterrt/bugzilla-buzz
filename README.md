# Intro
Create a smart summary of your work week by analyzing your bug trail.

The more useful your bugs are the more you'll want to keep them up to date.

# How to Use
You can't. I haven't written any code yet.

# Goals
* Identify all bugs I'm CC'd, Assigned, or mentioned in. (relevant bugs)
* Identify recently modified relevant bugs
* Identify zombie bugs

# Heads up
This is an early proof of concept for personal use.
Don't expect this to be stable or usable just yet.
